# Airline-Data-Pipeline
Project Description:

This project aims to build a data pipeline for airline data using various AWS services, enabling efficient data ingestion, transformation, and storage, as well as data analysis. The pipeline will leverage services such as Amazon S3, AWS Glue, AWS Glue Crawler, AWS Glue Visual Tool, Amazon Redshift, AWS Step Functions, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon EventBridge.

The project consists of the following components:

Data Sources:
airports.csv: A master data file containing airport information with fields such as airport_id, city, state, and name.
flights.csv: A fact data file containing flight details with fields such as carrier, OriginAirport, DestAirport, Departure_Delay, and Arrival_Delay.
Data Ingestion:
The airline data files (airports.csv and flights.csv) will be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, which will serve as the data lake for the project.
Data Transformation and Storage:
AWS Glue Crawler will be used to crawl the data sources in the S3 bucket and automatically infer the schema.
AWS Glue Visual Tool will be employed to create and manage ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs for data transformation and loading.
The transformed data will be loaded into Amazon Redshift, a cloud data warehouse, for efficient querying and analysis.
Automation:
AWS Step Functions will be utilized to orchestrate and automate the entire data pipeline process, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading into Redshift.
AWS CloudTrail will be integrated to log and monitor API activity, providing visibility into the pipeline operations.
Amazon EventBridge will be used to create event pattern rules, triggering the Step Functions workflow based on specific events, such as new data arriving in the S3 bucket.
Data Analysis:
Once the data is loaded into Redshift, various analytical queries and reports can be generated to gain insights into airline operations, flight delays, and other relevant metrics.
The analysis can include exploring relationships between airports, carriers, and flight delays, as well as identifying patterns and trends in the data.
The project will leverage AWS services to build a robust, scalable, and automated data pipeline, enabling efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis for the airline data. The automation and event-driven architecture will ensure timely data processing and facilitate data-driven decision-making for airline operations and resource planning.
